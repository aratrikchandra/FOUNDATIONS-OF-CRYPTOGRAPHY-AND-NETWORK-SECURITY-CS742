In the OFB (Output Feedback) mode of operation, the same IV (Initialization Vector) is used for every encryption. This can lead to a security vulnerability if a plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext are known.

Hereâ€™s how an attacker could derive the plaintext P2:

First, the attacker would XOR the known plaintext P1 with its corresponding ciphertext C1 to obtain the keystream used in the encryption.
Then, the attacker would XOR this keystream with the unknown ciphertext C2 to obtain the unknown plaintext P2.
